# MongoDB Collection Structure Decision Note

## Context

The decision involves whether to create separate MongoDB collections for different types of form models, each with varying numbers of documents (600, 30, and 80), or to consolidate them into a single collection. The concern lies in balancing query performance with code complexity.

## Key Points to Consider

### Query Performance
MongoDB should handle a total of 710 documents efficiently, provided that appropriate indexing is in place.

### Code Complexity
Multiple collections could increase the complexity of the codebase, as managing multiple collection references might become cumbersome.

### Scalability
While scaling could be a future concern, the current document counts do not justify separate collections.

### Data Model
If the structure of the forms is mostly similar, a single collection is easier to manage.

### Query Patterns
A single collection with an indexed field for the form type can be effective for most querying needs.

### Aggregation
Complex aggregation operations could be both a pro and a con. Separate collections might make some queries faster but could also introduce complexity.

### Atomic Operations
Transactions involving multiple form types could be simpler if all forms reside in a single collection.

## Recommendation

Given the current scale and the concern about code complexity, it's advisable to start with a single MongoDB collection. Include a field in each document that specifies its form type (e.g., "Memorization", "Ten Qira'at", "Best Voice") and index this field for efficient querying.

> **Note**: The structure can always be re-evaluated and modified in the future as requirements evolve.
