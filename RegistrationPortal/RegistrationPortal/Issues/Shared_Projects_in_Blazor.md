# Creating a Shared Project for Client and Server in Blazor Applications

## Overview

In Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) applications or in any client-server architecture, there's often a need to share certain classes or components between the client and server projects. Creating a shared project is a practical approach to centralize these shared assets, making the architecture cleaner and more maintainable.

## Benefits of a Shared Project

### Code Reusability

- **DRY Principle**: Follow the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle. Any common logic or component need not be repeated; it's centralized in the shared project.

### Consistency

- **Unified Data Models**: Using the same models on both client and server ensures data consistency across the application.

### Simplified Maintenance

- **Single Point of Change**: When you need to update a shared class or component, you only have to do it in one place. This reduces the risk of discrepancies that can lead to bugs.

### Easier Testing

- **Common Logic**: Since the logic is centralized, you don't have to write tests for the same logic twice. This can make your test suite easier to manage and more robust.

### Efficient Collaboration

- **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend and backend developers can work simultaneously on their respective components, knowing that the shared code is consistent for both.

## Points to Consider

### Security Implications

- Ensure that no server-specific logic or data leaks into the client side. Server-side validation and other logic should still be executed securely on the server.

### Code Coupling

- Be aware that changes in the shared code will affect both client and server. Both should be tested thoroughly to ensure that there are no unintended consequences.

### Version Control

- It's easier to manage versioning for a shared project, but it also means that changes have a broader impact.

## Without a Shared Project

It's worth mentioning that you can also operate without a shared project, especially when the server has a reference to the client project. This approach still allows for reusability of classes but may lack the structural advantages of a separate shared project.

## Summary

Creating a shared project for classes and components common to both client and server projects can greatly improve code reusability and maintainability. It is, however, crucial to manage the shared code carefully to prevent any security risks or bugs.

By weighing the benefits against the considerations, you can decide whether a shared project would be beneficial for your specific use case.
